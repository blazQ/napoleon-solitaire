# Napoleon Solitaire
## The game
A very small project made as an introduction to the Godot engine, and to game development in general.
Features a fully functional 3D drag and drop card system, dynamic rules (which currently implement a very basic variant of Solitaire) and various graphical effects and sound effects.
Also experimenting with dynamic audio, damped oscillators, animation and simple 3D modelling.
Card textures available on Kenney.
